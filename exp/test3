e) Use the "find" command to recursively find:

   a) All files whose name ends in .c

   b) All files whose size exceeds 10k.

f) Use the "dd" command to create a file exactly 10 mega bytes in size.

g) Create an ext2 file system on this file using "mke2fs" command.

h) Find out what is meant by a "loopback mount". Demonstrate loop back
mount using the file which you created in steps (f) and (g).


i) Use "mknod" to create a character special file with major number 100 and
